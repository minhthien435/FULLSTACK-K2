        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am <i>extremely </i>excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i>In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerede the food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<i>Cooking fir Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
